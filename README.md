Bash Script for Downloading Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Data from the GEO Database
Purpose
This bash script is designed to download fastq data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for a list of accession numbers. The script uses the SRA toolkit's fastq-dump command to download the raw fastq data for each accession number in the list. The script can handle both single-end and paired-end sequencing data.

Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

Save the script as a file on your local machine (e.g., download_data.sh).
Make the script executable by running chmod +x download_data.sh in the terminal.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by typing ./download_data.sh [-p] accession_list output_directory in the terminal.
The script takes the following command line arguments:

-p: (optional) flag to indicate paired-end sequencing. If this flag is provided, the script will download the paired-end fastq data. If this flag is not provided, the script will download the single-end fastq data.
accession_list: file containing a list of accession numbers, one per line. This file is required.
output_directory: directory where you want to save the fastq files. This directory is required. If the directory does not exist, the script will create it.
Here is an example command to run the script:

bash
Copy code
./download_data.sh -p accession_list.txt /path/to/output/directory
This command will download the paired-end fastq data for each accession number in the file accession_list.txt and save the data to the directory /path/to/output/directory. If you want to download single-end fastq data, omit the -p flag.

Output
The script will download the fastq data for each accession number in the list to the directory you specified. For paired-end sequencing data, the script will create two fastq files for each accession number (e.g., accession_number_1.fastq and accession_number_2.fastq). For single-end sequencing data, the script will create one fastq file for each accession number (e.g., accession_number.fastq).

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues when running the script, try the following:

Make sure you have the SRA toolkit installed on your machine.
Make sure the script is saved as a file and is executable (run chmod +x download_data.sh to make it executable).
Make sure you are running the script from the correct directory.
Make sure the accessions file and output directory are specified correctly.
Make sure the accessions file contains a list of valid accession numbers.
